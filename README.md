# Code for grid cell analysis

For replicating specific figures from the paper, please see scripts in OverallAnalysis. Details on which scripts is needed for which figure are in: Gerlei_et_at_2020_where_to_find_data_and_code.xlsx

The grid cell data is available from: https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/

To use the code for analyzing spatial cells such as head direction cells and grid cells, see scripts in PostSorting.
There is a script with some examples of using functions in PostSorting to make plots in https://github.com/MattNolanLab/grid_cell_analysis/blob/master/example_spatial_analysis.py



Please don't hesitate to email or submit an issue if there's a problem.
