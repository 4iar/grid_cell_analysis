# Code for grid cell analysis

For replicating specific figures from the paper, please see scripts in OverallAnalysis. Details on which script is needed for which figure are in: Gerlei_et_at_2020_where_to_find_data_and_code.xlsx

The grid cell data is available from: https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To use the code for analyzing spatial cells such as head direction cells and grid cells, see scripts in PostSorting.
See some examples of using PostSorting here:

There is more detailed documentation on how the code is organized and what the main data frames contain:
